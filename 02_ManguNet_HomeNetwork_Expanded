# ManguNet Home Network Expanded

**Lab Type:** Cisco Packet Tracer Simulation  
**Objective:** Expand the original ManguNet home network into a dual-LAN /25 subnet architecture with router-based segmentation, switch port-security, and a converted Access Point for wireless connectivity.

###High-Level Design

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
Network Type | Dual-LAN home network (Home + Guest)  
Segmentation Method | /25 subnetting  
Routing | Cisco 2911 static inter-LAN routing  
Security | Sticky-MAC port security on LAN-A switch  
Wireless | WRT300N converted to Access Point (DHCP disabled)

##Network Subnets

| LAN | Subnet | Mask | Gateway |
|---|---|---|---|
LAN-A (Home) | 192.168.1.0/25 | 255.255.255.128 | 192.168.1.1 |
LAN-B (Guest) | 192.168.1.128/25 | 255.255.255.128 | 192.168.1.129 |

##Device & IP Scheme

### LAN-A (Home Network)

| Device | IP | Connection |
|---|---|---|
PC-Jovany | 192.168.1.10 | Wired  
PC-Family | 192.168.1.11 | Wired  
Laptop-Loaner | 192.168.1.12 | Wired  
PRN-Home | 192.168.1.13 | Wired  
AP-ManguNet | 192.168.1.2 | Wired (AP mode)  

### LAN-B (Guest Network)

| Device | IP | Connection |
|---|---|---|
Guest PC 1 | 192.168.1.130 | Wired  
Guest PC 2 | 192.168.1.131 | Wired  
PRN-Guest | 192.168.1.132 | Wired

##Verification

| Test | Result |
|---|---|
LAN-A devices ping each other | ✓  
LAN-B devices ping each other | ✓  
Cross-LAN ping through router | ✓  
Sticky MAC blocks unauthorized device | ✓  
AP reachable & DHCP disabled | ✓

##Lessons Learned

- Planning and implementing `/25` subnetting
- Router configuration for multi-LAN communication
- Enforcing Layer-2 access control with sticky MAC security
- Converting a consumer router to AP mode & disabling DHCP
- Documenting network design and addressing tables clearly

---

##Next Improvements

- Add VLANs + trunking instead of physical segmentation
- Implement ACLs to restrict traffic between LANs
- Add DHCP server for automated address assignment
- Introduce firewall or pfSense for perimeter security
